This is my First Project as a Data Analyst Intern at Unified Mentor Private Limited. This project involved Netflix Data: Cleaning, Analysis, and Visualization, Data obtained from Unified Mentor Private Limited itself.
# Netflix Content Analysis and Visualization

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of Netflix's content library using **MySQL** and **Tableau**. The project explores trends, patterns, and insights from Netflix's dataset, providing valuable information about its movies and TV shows.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze Netflix's data and create interactive visualizations to better understand the platform's content distribution and trends. This includes examining:
- Content types (Movies vs. TV Shows)
- Country-wise contributions
- Ratings and target audiences
- Movie durations and TV show seasons
- Yearly release trends

## Features

### Data Processing
- Data loaded and cleaned using **MySQL Workbench**.
- SQL queries written to process and extract meaningful insights from the dataset.

### Data Analysis
- Explored the most prolific countries contributing to Netflix's content.
- Analyzed ratings to understand audience targeting.
- Investigated trends in release years to showcase content evolution.
- Studied distributions of movie durations and TV show seasons.

### Data Visualization
- Interactive and insightful dashboards created using **Tableau**.
- Visualizations include bar charts, line graphs, and distribution plots for better understanding and presentation.

## Tools Used
- **MySQL Workbench**: To query and analyze the dataset.
- **Tableau Public**: To design interactive dashboards and visualizations.

## How to Use

1. **Dataset**: The project uses Netflix's dataset, which can be downloaded from Kaggle or other sources.
2. **SQL Scripts**: All SQL queries used for data extraction are included in the `SQL_Queries` folder.
3. **Tableau Files**: The Tableau workbooks can be accessed in the `Tableau_Workbooks` folder.
4. **Visualizations**: Screenshots and descriptions of the dashboards are available in the `Visualizations` folder.

## Key Findings

1. The United States leads in content contribution, followed by India and the United Kingdom.
2. Most movies fall within the 90-120 minute range, while TV shows predominantly have 1-2 seasons.
3. TV-MA and TV-14 are the most common content ratings, targeting mature audiences.
4. Netflix has steadily increased its content production over the years, with a significant surge in the last decade.
